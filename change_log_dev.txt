2016.06.14
- Removed the preview section, as I am not going to build it.
- Fixed some div hieghts in the stylesheet for compatibility with Firefox 47.

13.01.13
- theme_builder.js Line 119 - Changed (i=="120") to (i=224"), so that the name and "not color" values would print out in the right spot aphabetically. I somehow overlooked that all this time... :)
- theme_builder.html - Added description for the textMagic element.
- Added Alpha Blue preloaded theme.

13.01.07
- Added new default theme, Midnight Blue.
- Cleaned up the drop down menu html by removing an unused class.
- Added descriptions in the tooltips for all the values I could determine (which took several hours of effort).
- Added a close button to color swath selector pop up by adding {pickerClosable:true} to all the class="color" tags in theme_builder.html.
- Eliminated redundant theme loading function called themeLoader(form)
	- theme_builder.js Line 17 - Changed function templateLoader(theme) to function templateLoader(theme, preLTrue, userLoadedTheme) so that it can accept the data sent to it from the Input Variables window to load a theme.
	- templateLoader now checks to see if a preloaded theme is being loaded or if the user is inputing one. 
	- cleaned up the the code that changes the color selector values, which was required to accomodate the close button above (and it's four times more effecient this way).
- Made changes to toop tips
	- tooltip/script.js - Changes to prevent the tooltips from going off the viewable area of the screen. Noted in the file comments.
- tooltip/style.css - Changed background, text, and border color. Made formatting consistent with my style.
	- theme_builder.css - input: hover now has a 3px red border to match tool tips and make it easier to tell which value one is looking at.
- Created a significantly better help section at the bottom of the page.
- Reduced the file size of the "preview" images by 10 times.

- Completely changed the layout to show all colors at once, making it easier to compare them.
