# Palettes By the SWG Community

In each the files within this directory you will find palettes created by members of the SWG community over the years. You can copy one palette at a time into the tool if you'd like to modify it. Additionally, you can copy some or all of them into your ui_palette_ground.inc file to use them in the game as they are. Many are quite good!  

It should be noted that some themes were designed to look nice with various UI/HUD mods, so they may not look quite right out of that context.  

Credits are in the file names and inside the files, as best I was able to locate.
